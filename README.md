- **Random Selection**: When the lottery reaches the required participant count, a random selection process is initiated to choose the lucky winner from the pool of participants. This element of chance adds excitement and unpredictability to the lottery.

**Solidity-Powered Experience:**
Solidity, a powerful and secure smart contract programming language, is used to create this Simple Lottery Contract. Solidity ensures perfect lottery execution and accurate handling of all transactions.
